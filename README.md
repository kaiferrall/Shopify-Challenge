<h1>Shopify Challenge 2021</h1>
<p>Hi there, this repository is my submission for the Shopify 2021 challenge.</p>
<small>Please note the application is hosted for free with Heroku, there may be some latency on the initial site load.</small>
<p><b>Find the app here:</b> <a href="http://myimagegallery.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Quik Gallery</a></p>
<br/>
<h2>My Idea</h2>
<p>
  I wanted to create a quick and accessible way to create your own image gallery and share it with friends.
  I also wanted to utilize a public API to give users access to a large data set of photos which they can use
  to create a totally custom gallery.
</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>On the main page, in the left search bar you can query for images by their contents.</p>
<p>With the results of your search you can select images you want to add to your current gallery.</p>
<p>You can also deselect or delete photos if you change your mind while creating.</p>
<p>Once your done creating, you can input your galleries name and then hit save.</p>
<p>After creating your gallery you will get a link to access that gallery and share with friends.</p>
<p>Galleries are valid for up to 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>My application is built with React.js, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.</p>
<p>Images are supplied via the Pixabay API.</p>
<p>The application is hosted with Heroku.</p>

<h2>Development Environment</h2>
<p>For testing and development clone this repository.</p>
<p>I have purposely left the database uri in this repo for now, to allow for easy local usage.</p> 
<p>Run npm install in root and root/client</p>
<p>Run npm start in root and root/client to start running a local instances.</p>
